# Scriptly
A native Windows desktop app that transforms selected text with AI — from any application, without breaking your flow.
Select text anywhere → press the hotkey → choose an action → get the result in seconds.

---

## How It Works

1. Select any text in any application (VS Code, Chrome, Notepad, Word, etc.)
2. Press the global hotkey (`Ctrl+Shift+Space` by default)
3. A floating action panel appears near your cursor
4. Pick an action (keyboard or mouse)
5. The AI result appears in a result window
6. Click **Replace** to swap the original text in-place, or **Copy** to grab it

Scriptly lives entirely in the system tray — no taskbar entry, no open windows when idle.

---

## Features

- **Global hotkey** — works while any app is in focus
- **Smart action ordering** — detects whether you selected code, an email, a long paragraph, or a short sentence and reorders actions accordingly
- **12 built-in actions** — Fix Grammar, Summarize, Translate, Expand, Shorten, Change Tone, Rewrite, Explain, Bullet Points, Casual Tone, Improve Writing, Explain Code
- **Custom actions** — create your own actions with a name, icon, description, and a prompt using `{text}` as the placeholder
- **Two AI providers** — OpenRouter (access to hundreds of models) or Groq (fast inference)
- **In-place Replace** — sends Ctrl+V back to the source app to replace the original selection
- **Keyboard navigation** — ↑/↓ arrows to browse actions, Enter to execute, Escape to dismiss
- **GPU-accelerated animations** — smooth open/close transitions on the floating panels
- **Per-monitor DPI aware** — sharp on any display scaling

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or later (x64)
- [.NET 10 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0) (Windows Desktop Runtime)
- An API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) or [Groq](https://console.groq.com)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/scriptly.git
cd scriptly/Scriptly
dotnet build -c Release
```

### 2. Run

```bash
dotnet run
# or after build:
.\bin\Release\net10.0-windows\Scriptly.exe
```

The app starts silently in the system tray (look for the **S** icon near the clock).

### 3. Configure

Right-click the tray icon → **Settings**

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Provider** | Choose OpenRouter or Groq |
| **API Key** | Paste your API key for the selected provider |
| **Model** | Enter the model name (e.g. `openai/gpt-4o-mini` for OpenRouter, `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` for Groq) |
| **Hotkey** | Choose modifier keys (Ctrl, Shift, Alt, Win) and a trigger key |

### 4. Use it

- Select any text in any app
- Press your hotkey (`Ctrl+Shift+Space` by default)
- Choose an action from the panel
- The result window shows a loading animation while the AI processes
- Click **Copy** or **Replace**, or press **Escape** to dismiss

## AI Provider Setup

### OpenRouter

1. Sign up at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
2. Go to **Keys** → create a new API key
3. Choose a model — recommended starting points:
   - `openai/gpt-4o-mini` — fast and cheap
   - `anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku` — excellent writing quality
   - `google/gemini-flash-1.5` — very fast, good quality

### Groq

1. Sign up at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
2. Go to **API Keys** → create a new key
3. Choose a model — recommended:
   - `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` — best quality
   - `llama-3.1-8b-instant` — fastest

## Settings File

Settings are stored as JSON at:

```\n%AppData%\Scriptly\settings.json
```

You can edit this file directly if needed. Delete it to reset to defaults.

## Logs

Scriptly writes debug logs to:

```\n%AppData%\Scriptly\debug.log
```

Capture diagnostics logs (`[CAPTURE] ...`) are enabled by default for public builds.
To disable capture diagnostics, set this environment variable before launching Scriptly:

```powershell
$env:SCRIPTLY_CAPTURE_DIAGNOSTICS = "0"
```

## Known Limitations

- **Elevated (admin) apps** — Scriptly cannot send keystrokes to apps running as administrator (e.g. Task Manager) unless Scriptly itself is also run as admin. This is a Windows UIPI restriction.
- **Some apps intercept Ctrl+C** — terminal emulators or apps with custom keyboard handling may not copy to the clipboard on Ctrl+C.
- **Replace only works if text is still selected** — if the source app loses its selection before the result window closes, Replace will paste at the cursor instead.
